# COMP359- Assignment 1 
Compare quicksort against itself when implemented with different choices of pivot selection strategies.

## Objective

Our goal is to empirically measure the time efficiency of quicksort on a variety of arrays with different constraints. We account for pivot position, pre-sorting status, and size of the array. We also consider the impact of differing hardware and system environments on the timing results.
